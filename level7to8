//The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt next to the word millionth

First we have to connect to bandit using the command : ssh bandit7@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
Then we have to enter the password which we got from the previous question.
Then we will list all the files using : ls -alps
Now we will cat the contents od the data.txt file using : cat data.txt
Then we will use strings command to sort .
Inorder to get the password stored in the text file next to the given word we use grep command:
strings data.txt | grep "millionth"
Now we get the password for level 8 , and we exit from level 7.

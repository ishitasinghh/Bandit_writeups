//The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt, which contains base64 encoded data.

First we have to connect to bandit using the command : ssh bandit10@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
Then we have to enter the password which we got from the previous question.
We can access the content of the file using data.txt file.
Now we will decode the base64 using: base64 -d data.txt , which will decode the data and give us the password for level 11.

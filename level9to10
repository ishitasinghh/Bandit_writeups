//The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt in one of the few human-readable strings, preceded by several ‘=’ characters.

First we have to connect to bandit using the command : ssh bandit9@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220.
Then we have to enter the password which we got from the previous question.
Now we can use : strings data.txt | grep "=" .
After this we get the password for level 10 and then we exit from level 9.

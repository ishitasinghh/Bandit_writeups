//The password for the next level is stored in a file somewhere under the inhere directory and has all of the following properties:
  human-readable
  1033 bytes in size
  not executable
  
First we have to connect to bandit using the command : ssh bandit5@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
Then we have to enter the password which we got from the previous question.
Next we have to list all files using the command:  ls
Then we go to the inhere directory using : cd inhere/
Now we enter the file type along with the parameters given:find . -type f -size 1033c ! -executable (c= bytes , b=blocks)
Then it will give us the file and we will cat the content of the file .
After this we get the password for level 6 and then we exit from level 5.

//The goal of this level is for you to log into the game using SSH. The host to which you need to connect is bandit.labs.overthewire.org, on port 2220.
The username is bandit0 and the password is bandit0. Once logged in, go to the Level 1 page to find out how to beat Level 1.

//The password for the next level is stored in a file called readme located in the home directory.
Use this password to log into bandit1 using SSH. Whenever you find a password for a level, use SSH (on port 2220) to log into that level and continue the game.

First we have to connect to bandit using the command : ssh bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
Then we have to enter the password given in the question.
Next we have to list all files using the command:  ls -alps
Then we open the read me file using : cat readme.
After this we get the password for level 1 and then we exit from level 0.

//The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt and is the only line of text that occurs only once

First we have to connect to bandit using the command : ssh bandit8@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
Then we have to enter the password which we got from the previous question.
Then we will cat the content of the file using : cat data.txt
Then we will use the sort command to sort the content in alphabetical order : sort data.txt.
we can use the man uniq command to get the number of times a line is repeated : sort data.txt | uniq -c, which will give us the line that is repeated only once .
After this we get the password for level 9 and then we exit from level 8.

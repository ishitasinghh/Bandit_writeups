//The password for the next level is stored in a hidden file in the inhere directory.

First we have to connect to bandit using the command : ssh bandit3@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
Then we have to enter the password given in the question.
Next we have to list all files using the command:  ls -alps
Then we go to the inhere directory using : cd inhere/
Next we have to list all files using the command:  ls -al.
Now we have to go to the hidden file using: cat .hidden

//The password for the next level is stored in a file called spaces in this filename located in the home directory

First we have to connect to bandit using the command : ssh bandit2@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
Then we have to enter the password which we got from level 1.
Next we have to list all files using the command:  ls -alps
Then we open the read me file using : cat spaces\ in\ this\ filename (giving spaces to denote that this file has spaces)
After this we get the password for level 3 and then we exit from level 2.

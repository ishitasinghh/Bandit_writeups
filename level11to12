//The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt, where all lowercase (a-z) and uppercase (A-Z) letters have been rotated by 13 positions.

First we have to connect to bandit using the command : ssh bandit11@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
Then we have to enter the password which we got from the previous question.
Now we will cat the content of data.txt file (cat data.txt) , after that we will use cyberchef to decode ROT13, and get the password for level 12.
